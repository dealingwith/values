# Overview

In general, I would like to live in a way more intentionally aligned with my personal beliefs and aesthetic. For me that means treating myself, others and my environment (collectively what might be considered the Other) with respect and gratitude. Respect primarily for shared resources like time and energy, those being large umbrellas covering everything from email length to fossil fuel consumption. (Perhaps I will attempt a list someday.) It also includes respecting intent (believing the best about the other), emotion (understanding we all occupy a shared emotional space) and space (an appreciation of the physicality of our existence).

There are currently many compromises I have made in regard to these goals, most of which have been justified in the name of providing for my family. (Some are simply the result of the collected decisions of my years, most of which appear individually amoral with the forgiveness of time.) For example: as part of my occupation, I current work on developing a product that, like most marketing products, shows little respect for others' time and attention.

Another compromise I currently make is a general disregard for my environment's resources. I drive when not necessary, I waste when it is expedient to do so. I am frivolous with my monetary resources in the name of saving time resources. I am short-sighted in my planning and contemplation in the name of shoring up short-term emotional reserves. 

# A Plan

> Control of consciousness determines the quality of life.

-- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

There has always been a desire to live within an ethical framework defined by said beliefs. Earlier in life this desire was largely constrained by a faith in a mainstream (and often conflicting) Christian theology. As those beliefs solidified, they began to require a structure of their own. This document might be considered a bit of the timber.

## Principles

In no particular order.

#### Humility and Simplicity

Humility is often thought of as weakness when in fact it is strength. It is the ability to wait out the storms of others' egos. It is the strength and confidence to not be heard. It is a lack of need or desire for recognition or acceptance. As the antithesis of ego, it builds instead of destroys, illuminates instead of blinds. Humility is required for effective leadership, for it is the underpinning of understanding, clear thinking, confident action. Humility allows for simplicity, which is the foundation for good design.

> Being simple can make you feel vulnerable. But simplicity is really an achievement--it follows from hard-won clarity about what matters.

> Modesty is the opposite of being showy. It is part of a broader ideal of service--which is a central ideal of good capitalism. One is not there to attract attention; one is there to help the customer to live a better life.

> True modesty comes from confidence. Modesty is a lack of anxiety about being ignored.

-- [The School of Life on Dieter Rams](http://www.thebookoflife.org/dieter-rams/) 

#### Complexity and Mystery

Part of humility, acceptance, appreciation and eventually the embrace of the unknown and unknowable must be considered core to a satisfying life.

#### Faith

> I am not a believing Christian, but I am a practicing Christian.

-- Freeman Dyson

At the same time, it is important to me to believe in some existence beyond what any one person can see or feel, a thread that connects us in a transcendental way. This Other is often found in others, and in the struggles of life. The concepts and principles of spiritual practice are ancient and varied but at the same time evergreen and universal. To deny them is not only futile but an act of ignorance. Wisdom would suggest that we remain open to the possibilities of that beyond our senses and intellect.

#### Hope and Abundance

Of those qualities of that which is beyond, a sense of hope and an abundance mentality are of significant importance.

#### Gratitude and Generosity

Out of this abundance comes both gratitude and generosity. 

#### Grit

> Grit...is a positive, non-cognitive trait based on an individual's passion for a particular long-term goal or endstate, coupled with a powerful motivation to achieve their respective objective. This perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of obstacles or challenges that lie within a gritty individual’s path to accomplishment, and serves as a driving force in achievement realization. Commonly associated concepts within the field of psychology include "perseverance", "hardiness", "resilience", "ambition", "need for achievement" and "conscientiousness". ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_%28personality_trait%29))

#### The Immutability and Amorality of Suffering

I have suffered the loss of a child, something not uncommon but a loss I grieved with particular affect. While I hope to never experience that kind of personal tremor again, I live with the understanding that suffering visits all, regardless of their nature, behavior, thoughts or beliefs.

#### Honesty and Faithfulness in Relationships

## Actions

> What does it profit if someone says he has faith but does not have works?

-- James 2:14

#### Sobriety

To remain sober from drugs and alcohol one day at a time.

#### Conservation

> What is the use of a house if you haven’t got a tolerable planet to put it on?

-- Thoreau

#### Focus

> It is by being fully involved with every detail of our lives that we find happiness.

-- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

##### Deep Work

#### Health

##### Mental Heath
##### Physical Fitness
##### Habits

#### Giving

## Practical Matters

#### Providing for my Dependents

To provide for our collective needs, but not in excess, remaining within my own ethical guidelines.

#### Transportation

To use an automobile as little as possible.

#### Use of "Social" Technologies

I do not use so-called "social software". I require my technological tools to respect my time and attention and my social communities to be intentional, respectful and as un-mediated as possible.

#### Reading and Contemplation

To set aside time to read and write.

#### Fitness

To set aside time to exercise. To consume foods responsibly and with intentionality towards my physical health. To have healthy habits in regards to consumption, rest, etc.

#### Communication

To communicate clearly with those around me and, when appropriate, with a broader audience.

#### Time Management

#### Changes

To accept change and difference gracefully; to remain flexible.

#### The Products I Build and the Services I Provide

To build things of enduring value, that honor the other in both intent and execution.
